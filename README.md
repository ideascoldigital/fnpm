A unified package manager interface that helps teams standardize their workflow while allowing developers to use their preferred tool (npm, yarn, or pnpm). FNPM ensures consistent lock files across the team regardless of individual package manager preferences, making it easier to maintain dependencies and avoid conflicts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Unified Interface**: Use the same commands regardless of your preferred package manager
- **Seamless Hooks**: Intercept direct package manager commands (e.g., `pnpm add` → `fnpm add`)
- **Team Consistency**: Enforce consistent lock files across your team
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects existing package managers in your project
- **Interactive Setup**: Guided configuration process
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## 📦 Installation

### Using the install script (Recommended)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ideascoldigital/fnpm/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual installation
1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ideascoldigital/fnpm/releases)
2. Extract and move the binary to your PATH

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ideascoldigital/fnpm.git
cd fnpm
make install
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

To get started with fnpm, simply run:

```bash
fnpm
```

This will guide you through the setup process and help you configure your preferred package manager.

### Example Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
fnpm install

# Add a package
fnpm add lodash

# Add a dev dependency
fnpm add -D typescript

# Run scripts
fnpm run build
fnpm run test
```

## 🪝 Seamless Package Manager Integration

FNPM includes a powerful hooks system that allows your team to use their preferred package manager commands while ensuring consistency through fnpm.

### Quick Setup with Hooks
```bash
# Setup fnpm with automatic hook creation
fnpm setup pnpm

# Activate hooks (add to your shell profile for permanent activation)
source .fnpm/setup.sh
```

### Use Your Preferred Commands
Once hooks are activated, you can use your package manager directly:
```bash
# These commands are automatically redirected through fnpm
pnpm add express     # → fnpm add express
pnpm install         # → fnpm install  
pnpm run dev         # → fnpm run dev
yarn add lodash      # → fnpm add lodash (if yarn is configured)
```

### Hook Management
```bash
# Check hook status
fnpm hooks status

# Create/update hooks
fnpm hooks create

# Remove hooks
fnpm hooks remove

# Setup without hooks (for CI/CD)
fnpm setup --no-hooks npm
```

For detailed information about the hooks system, see [HOOKS.md](docs/HOOKS.md).
